#Step 1: Get pi from all 2 chromosomes for every demographic model and DFE using only masked files
>> python OtherScripts/get_pi_from_ms_chr22.py -demo ${demographic_model} -dfe sim${DFE} -rep ${replicate_num} -genome genome10 -burnin F

#where possible inputs:
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
#${DFE} = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
#${demographic_model} = (eqm, growth, decline)
#-burnin = (T, F) #calculating pi at or after burn-in

#Step 2: Summarize the pi values in a table readable by R
>> python summarize_pi_chr22.py #summarizes all obtained values in a table easily readable by R

#Step 3: Values of B were calculated as follows:
# B = (pi from ${demographic_model}, $DFE, ${replicate_num}, genome10) / (pi from ${demographic_model}, sim0, ${replicate_num}, genome10)
#mean and standard deviation was calculated between the 10 replicates for each $(demographic_model} and ${DFE} = (sim1, sim2, sim3, sim4, sim5, sim6)
