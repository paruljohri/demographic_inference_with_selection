#General workflow for simulating chromosomal segments of varying sizes under neutral equilibrium and inferring demography using MSMC 
#Updated on December 15, 2020

#Step1: simulations in SliM
slim -d d_seed=${seed} -d "d_repID='${replicate_num}'" -d "d_folder='${output_folder}'" SlimScripts/eqm_single_chr_${chr_size}.slim

#Possible inputs:
#${seed} = (any random seed of your choosing) = ${replicate_num}
#${chr_size} = (1Mb, 10Mb, 50Mb, 200Mb, 1Gb)
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100)
#${output_folder} = (folder that newly created .ms files will be output to)



#Step2: Randomly sample N haplotypes from the 100 haplotypes present in an .ms file
python OtherScripts/subsample_ms.py output_single_chr_${chr_size}_rep${replicate_num}.ms sampled_${chr_size}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num}.ms ${num_of_haplotypes}

#Possible inputs:
#${chr_size} = (1Mb, 10Mb, 50Mb, 200Mb, 1Gb)
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100)
#${num_of_individuals} = (this may be any value greater than or equal to 2, though for the purposes of this project, only values of 2, 4, and 8 were tested)



#Step3: make the input file (.tab format) for MSMC
less sampled_${chr_size_as_Str}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num}.ms |python ms2multihetsep.py "sampled_${chr_size_as_str}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num}.ms" $chr_size_as_int > converted_${chr_size_as_str}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num}.tab

#Possible inputs:
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100)
#${num_of_individuals} = (this may be any value greater than or equal to 2, though for the purposes of this study, only values of 2, 4, and 8 were tested)
#${chr_size_as_str} = (1Mb, 10Mb, 50Mb, 200Mb, 1Gb)
#$chr_size_as_int = (size of segment in base pairs, i.e. 1Mb would be 1000000)



#Step4: run MSMC
msmc_1.1.0_linux64bit -r 1.0 -t 1 -o raw_output_${chr_size}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num} converted_${chr_size}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num}.tab

#${chr_size} = (1Mb, 10Mb, 50Mb, 200Mb, 1Gb)
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100)
#${num_of_individuals} = (this may be any value greater than or equal to 2, though for the purposes of this study, only values of 2, 4, and 8 were tested)



#Step5: transform MSMC output files, average them and plot them
Use the "plot_msmc_single_segment.py" script.  The scenario parameters, including the segment size, number of replicated, and SNP density can be configured in the script itself.
