#This is the key to access the SFS files used as input files for fastsimcoal2 for varying chromosome sizes under neutral equilibrium.

#Files are named as follows: MASTER_${SNP_density}_${chr_size}_rep${replicate_num}_DAFpop0.obs
#where
#${SNP_density} = (all, thinned_5kb, thinned_50kb, thinned_100kb) #is the density at which SNPs were sampled from the simulated genomes
#${chr_size} = (1Mb, 10Mb, 50Mb, 200Mb, 1Gb) #size of the chromosomes simulated
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100) #For each chromosome size 100 replicates were simulated.
