1. I have deleted the folder called Plots.zip because we would have to update that if we want to keep it.\
This is what we had there - ">>All plots of MSMC and fastsimcoal2 results where inference for MSMC was perfomed using a single diploid individual and for fastsimcoal2 was performed using 50 diploid individuals with SNPs spaced out by 5 kb."\
can have if time


2. Upload MSMC_outputfiles- what is  easiest.
Folder structure or not? ~2,100 files
genome20/genome10/genome05 -> eqm/decline_6fold/growth_30fold/decline_2fold/growth_2fold -> neutrality/dfe1/dfe2/dfe3/dfe4/dfe5/dfe6.zip (20 files in each folder)

3. Upload SFS for FSC
Folder structure woudl be ~4,200 files
genome20/genome10/genome05 -> eqm/decline_6fold/growth_30fold/decline_2fold/growth_2fold -> neutrality/dfe1/dfe2/dfe3/dfe4/dfe5/dfe6.zip (40 files in each folder)

4. Upload output for FSC
Folder structure woudl be ~42,000 files
genome20/genome10/genome05 -> eqm/decline_6fold/growth_30fold/decline_2fold/growth_2fold -> neutrality/dfe1/dfe2/dfe3/dfe4/dfe5/dfe6.zip (400 files in each folder)


5. double check everything.
