1. I have deleted the folder called Plots.zip because we would have to update that if we want to keep it.\
This is what we had there - ">>All plots of MSMC and fastsimcoal2 results where inference for MSMC was perfomed using a single diploid individual and for fastsimcoal2 was performed using 50 diploid individuals with SNPs spaced out by 5 kb."\

2. What do we with the $ratio files?

3. Do we modify commandlines for each Figure?
