#General workflow for simulating chromosomal segments of varying sizes under neutral equilibrium and inferring demography using MSMC 
#Updated on December 7, 2020

#Step1: simulations in SliM
slim -d d_seed=${seed} -d "d_repID='${replicate_num}'" -d "d_folder='output_foldername'" SlimScripts/eqm_single_chr_${segment_size}.slim

#Possible inputs:
#${seed} = (any random seed of your choosing)
#${segment_size} = (1Mb, 10Mb, 50Mb, 200Mb, 1Gb)
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100)

#Alt Step 1: simulations in Msprime:
python MsprimeScripts/simulate_msprime.py eqm_neutral_10Mb_msp 10000000 1 ${replicate_num} ${seed}
python MsprimeScripts/simulate_msprime.py eqm_neutral_50Mb_msp 50000000 1 ${replicate_num} ${seed}
python MsprimeScripts/simulate_msprime.py eqm_neutral_200Mb_msp 200000000 1 ${replicate_num} ${seed}
python MsprimeScripts/simulate_msprime.py eqm_neutral_1Gb_msp 1000000000 1 ${replicate_num} ${seed}

#Possible inputs:
#${seed} = (any random seed of your choosing)
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100)



#Step2: Randomly sample N haplotypes from the 100 haplotypes present in an .ms file
python OtherScripts/subsample_ms.py ${chromosomes_location}/output_single_chr_${segment_size}_rep${replicate_num}.ms ${folder of your choosing}/sampled_${segment_size}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num}.ms ${num_of_haplotypes}

#Possible inputs:
#${segment_size} = (1Mb, 10Mb, 50Mb, 200Mb, 1Gb)
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100)
#${num_of_individuals} = (this may be any value greater than or equal to 2, though for the purposes of this study, only values of 2, 4, and 8 were tested)



#Step3: make the input file (.tab format) for MSMC
less ${folder of your choosing}/sampled_${segment_size}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num}.ms |python OtherScripts/ms2multihetsep.py "sampled_${segment_size}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num}.ms" $size > ${folder of your choosing}/converted_${segment_size}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num}.tab

#Possible inputs:
#${segment_size} = (1Mb, 10Mb, 50Mb, 200Mb, 1Gb)
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100)
#${num_of_individuals} = (this may be any value greater than or equal to 2, though for the purposes of this study, only values of 2, 4, and 8 were tested)
#$size = (size of segment in base pairs, i.e. 1Mb would be 1000000)



#Step4: run MSMC
msmc_1.1.0_linux64bit -r 1.0 -t 1 -o ${folder of your choosing}/raw_output_${segment_size}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num} ${folder of your choosing}/converted_${segment_size}_${num_of_haplotypes}indv_rep${replicate_num}.tab

#${segment_size} = (1Mb, 10Mb, 50Mb, 200Mb, 1Gb)
#${replicate_num} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100)
#${num_of_individuals} = (this may be any value greater than or equal to 2, though for the purposes of this study, only values of 2, 4, and 8 were tested)



#Step5: transform MSMC output files, average them and plot them
Use the "plot_msmc_and_fsc_results_single_segment.py" script.  The scenario parameters, including the segment size, number of replicated, and SNP density can be configured in the script itself.
