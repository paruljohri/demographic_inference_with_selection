So the folders themselves can vary based on the demographic model, the functional density, 
and the DFE shape. Within each of the final folders in a path though, all of the files 
going into said folder will still vary based on whether or not they are masked, 
as well as their SNP density for the FSC folders, but won't be seperated into 
individual folders. Also, for decline and growth, the 2x fold changes and 6x / 30x files 
will also all be together in that same end folder. Does this look good?
